# 1. Requisitos

**US2004** As Warehouse Employee, I want to access the list of orders that have already been prepared by the AGVs and be able to update any of those orders as having been dispatched for customer delivery.

- US2004.1. Show list of orders ...

- US2004.2. Select order ...

The interpretation made of this requirement was in the sense of creating a way to update the information of existing orders into the database.

# 2. Análise

*From the description of this user story, we know that:*


-Client basic information comprehends name,e-mail, billing address,postal address, birth date, phone number, vat and gender


-To promote integration with other information systems, a customer also has: a uniqueID


*Business Rules:*

# 3. Design


The way found to solve this problem was to create an UpdateOrderUI class that makes use of the
UpdateOrderController to create instances in order to guarantee the business rules given by the customer.
